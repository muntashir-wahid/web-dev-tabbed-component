              HTML (stands for Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language
              that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is
              a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a
              markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the
              style and structure of a document.

              In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed
              and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and
              share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
              Internet-based hypertext system.

              HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
              compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web
              pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
              defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or
              enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.

              Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing
              the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
              HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
              alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
              present the same markup page in different styles for different
              rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
              speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
              devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
              is accessed on a mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
              determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a
              particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

              JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is
              one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
              and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
              web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

              JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
              that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.It has dynamic typing,
              prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
              multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
              programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
              for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
              structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            </p>
            <p>
              The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O),
              such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice,
              the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
              I/O.
